Mythology has played an integral part in every civilization throughout the world. Pre-historic cave paintings, etchings in stone, tombs, and monuments all suggest that, long before human beings set down their myths in words, they had already developed a belief structure corresponding to the definition of `myth’ provided by Leach and Fried. According to psychiatrist Carl Jung, myth is a necessary aspect of the human psyche which needs to find meaning and order in a world which often presents itself as chaotic and meaningless.
Myths defined as a kind of imaginary story that had been included in history of Nepal. The myth can be found in every page of history book of nepal. we can found both positive and negative types of myths.

The infinite Jung references is the numinous quality of the mysterious, holy, and powerful which provides the underlying allure of mythological tales and themes because it gives a final meaning to human existence. The concept of something greater and more powerful than one’s self gives one the hope of direction and protection in an uncertain world. According to Leach and Fried, the mysterious, holy, and powerful is “a concept of the human mind from earliest times: the basic psychological reaction to the universe and environment which underlies all religion” (777).

The history of Buddhism of Nepal is basically of two types - mythological and documentary. The mythological narration pertaining to Buddhism is also regarded as very important supporting evidence for the study of Nepalese Buddhism. Although such narration deals with mythology as well as stories of the deeds and miraculous powers of Buddhist deities and the devotees, it is deeply rooted in the practical aspect of Nepalese Buddhist culture. Thus, before presenting documentary and archaeological evidence, it is necessary to examine the accounts which have a popular basis in the society. It is obvious that the former narratives have no scientific evidence to support their descriptions and do not stand up to the challenge of scientific analysis. However, it is always helpful to make an ideal interpretation of historical contexts and the continuity of Buddhism in Nepalese society through the belief of its followers. This continuity has remained unbroken since ancient times. The mythological sources of Buddhism in Nepal include narratives such as Svayambhu Purana, chronicles such as Bhasavamsavali, Gopalraj Vamsavali and other Vamsavalis, stories and accounts of the miraculous activities of the deities, the followers and so forth. The most important sources for gaining knowledge about the history of Nepalese Buddhist thoughts are the inscriptions from ancient and medieval periods. These are readily available as there are hundreds of such inscriptions that mention Buddhism. The inscriptions of the Lichhavis and the Mallas shed light on Buddhism in Nepal. The Licchavi inscriptions opine that Buddhism was in its full-fledged form during ancient time, and was favoured by the rulers. Many Kings favoured Buddhism and played an active role in its development. The inscription of Kings Mana Deva, Shiva Deva Narendra Deva, Jaya Deva and others provide important information about the Nepalese Buddhism of that period. Basically, the subject of such inscriptions relating to Buddhism are - the arrival of Vajrayana in Nepal, the Mahasanghika sect, the Buddhist Sangha, donations made to the Viharas, the consecration of deities, the cult of Avalokitesvara, Vajra Bhairav, Status of Bhikshu Sangha and Bhikshuni Sangha, jurisdiction of the Sangha etc. are also mentioned in the ancient and medieval inscriptions.1 In addition to these sources, there is ample documentary evidence that sheds light on Nepalese Buddhism particularly its historical development, literature, ritual activities, deities, practices, etc.

Such narratives function to motivate ecological activism by articulating such presuppositions as the conviction that what we do matters, destruction of nature is intrinsically wrong, and the possibility of nondestructive human beings. However, such narratives motivate only if they are regarded in some sense as true.
